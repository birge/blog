      <h3>Created By</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>My name is Birge "Dexter" Clark, a <%= Date.today.year - Date.strptime("02/24/1987", "%m/%d/%Y").year %> year old full stack developer with a growing interest in front-end development. I live in the Bay Area and have all my life. Currently I'm contracted full time with <a href="http://www.55minutes.com/">55 Minutes</a> working on a large scale AngularJS application but I am looking for new opportunities.</p>

      <p>Outside of work I like to spend time with family, friends and my pup. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as possible, including hiking, camping, and traveling. My home away from home is Tahoe, which I try to get to multiple times a year.</p>

      <h3>Interested In</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>I've been doing JavaScript and AngularJS almost exclusively for the last year and I still love it. I've been also keeping an eye on EmberJS and am interested in getting an opportunity to work with it. For the back-end I always choose Ruby on Rails. I've done some PHP and scratched the surface of Python + Django but always come back to RoR. With that said I really want to dive into NodeJS project because over the last year JavaScript has won me over.</p>

      <p>As far as build tools go I am partial to NPM, Bower, and Gulp.</p>
